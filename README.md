# Med-Day - for Pitt Challenge Hackathon 2023

Med-Day is an 8bit style, decision-based text game created to stimulate EMT protocols. Med-Day was created for the Pitt Challenge 2023 Healthcare Hackathon and won the 'Supporting Caregivers' track.

## Inspiration

EMT's provide immediate response and care to medical emergencies. Many EMT trainees struggle with proper execution of standard protocols for the many different scenarios they might face. In an anonymous survey, 1 out of every 5 EMTs admitted to committing at least one treatment error. There are also incredibly few resources available online for EMTs to practice protocols. Therefore, our team developed a game to assist aspiring EMTs in practicing these protocols and reducing errors in the field.

## What It Does

Our text-based story game takes players through an emergency field scenario and guides them to make correct choices by explaining standard protocols, pointing out mistakes, and explaining potential consequences. In the game, players have to quickly assess situations, interpret vitals information, and choose appropriate medical interventions. By playing scenarios over and over, players will be able to commit standard protocols to memory and better execute them in the field.

## How We Built It

We started by researching standard EMT protocol from the PA Basic Life Support Protocols handbook. We chose a cardiac chest pain scenario and storyboarded the progression of the game. Then we developed the menus, GUI, and integrated our story logic into the environment. Finally, we added music, sound effects, and pixel art. The code was created using python/pygame.

## Challenges We Ran Into

Our biggest challenge stemmed from our lack of experience with collaborative coding projects. It was everyone's first time creating a game, working on a collaborative coding project, and our first hackathons too. Our lack of experience led to issues such as version control, clarity, and developing a clean, modular environment. We were also on a time constraint as we had 36 hours to develop our product. Because of these issues, we were forced to cut ambitious features we wanted to include such as extra GUI elements, more complex logic, end-game feedback screen, and more scenarios/levels.

## What We're Proud Of and What We Learned

To be honest, getting the game as fleshed out as we did was pretty impressive to all of us. This is all of our first hackathons, and none of us had any experience in game development. So, we came in without high expectations and blew those out of the water. We're especially proud of creating something unique that we had genuine interest in and making the game charming with a pleasing aesthetic. 

Everyone learned a lot. We learned through trial and error about the game development process, graphic design, debugging, and *especially* disciplined collaborative coding. We also gained a better understanding of the emergency medicine scene and the important work that EMTs do.
